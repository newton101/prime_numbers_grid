### Prime Numbers Challenge

This is my solution to a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.
The program must run from the command line and print to screen 1 table.
The body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers.
The prime numbers should be calculated by you, instead use some method from your language.



#### Run the command below to see the solution.
